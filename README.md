I chose to use the <b>react-redux</b> framework to enable using a centralized store for all of our bills and state variables.
This approach helps by improving performance, providing a centralized api, and helps organizing the code.

## Libraries used in this exercise:



* `React` 
* `Redux` for managing state in a centralized store
* `Webpack` for creating debug and release builds
* `reactstrap` bootstrap react library
* `font-awesome` icon package
* `react-chartjs2` chart library
* `PHP`  for creating a serverside API
* `Express`  for creating a node development server and API
* `axios` for ajax calls
* `More...`
